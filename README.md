### About The Game
Mobile 2D endless runner made in Unity. Inspired by Chrome's offline dino game, but with a "boss-battle feel" to it. You're a hoverboard riding monkey chasing masked mooks who are firing projectiles at you.

### Gameplay Details
* You can jump, duck, and dash down to avoid enemy projectiles.
* The enemies fire at you until their gun shoots a "flawed" shot, which your character automatically returns to hit the enemy with their own shot.
* Each time an enemy is defeated, the hero turns around to go the opposite direction, just to mix it up a bit.
